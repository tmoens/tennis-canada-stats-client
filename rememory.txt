Deployment

To make a production build
> ng build --base-href=/TCStatsClient/ --configuration=production
which will create a directory called TCStatsAdmin

To deploy it, copy the TCStatsClient directory to path/to/your/server/TCStatsClient.
For a local xampp deployment, put the TCStatsClient in the htdocs directory under xampp.

Generally
1) deploy it locally and test it out
2) deploy to staging on TC server and test it out
3) deploy to production and test it out
