Deployment

Local production build served by node itself - just a test for running the client in production mode.
> ng serve --prod

Actual production build. The build shows up under dist/statsadmin ready for deployment to your web server
> ng build --base-href=/TCStatsClient/ --prod

To deploy it, deliver the dist/statsadmin as path/to/your/server/TCStatsClient.
For an xampp deployment, the server is in the htdocs directory under xampp.
Generally
1) deploy it locally and test it out
2) deploy to staging on TC server and test it out
3) deploy to production and test it out
