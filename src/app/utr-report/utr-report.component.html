        <p>
          The UTR Report is generated automatically every second day.
          You should not have to run it manually unless there was a recently
          corrected tournament or ranking and the UTR report has to be
          generated immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even then you need to wait at least two hours after
          the correction has been made to ensure that the automated
          loaders have pulled in the corrected tournaments and rankings
          into the Tennis Canada database from te VR API.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even then, it is not clear that once you correct the rankings
          in the VR system, that they will be available through the VR API
          immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bottom line - probably it is best just to wait for the system to
          generate the next automated UTR report.
