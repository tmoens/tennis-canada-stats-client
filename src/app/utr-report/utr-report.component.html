            <p>
              The UTR Report is generated automatically every second day.
              You should not have to run it manually unless there was a recently
              corrected tournament or ranking and the UTR report has to be
              generated immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even then you need to wait at least two hours after
              the correction has been made to ensure that the automated
              loaders have pulled in the corrected tournaments and rankings
              into the Tennis Canada database from te VR API.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even then, it is not clear that once you correct the rankings
              in the VR system, that they will be available through the VR API
              immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bottom line - probably it is best just to wait for the system to
              generate the next automated UTR report.
